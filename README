4) REQUIREMENTS
===============
* GNU Colecction Compiler (gcc)
* GNU make (make).

5) INSTALLATION
===============
For GNU/Linux clean and generate necessary files

   $>make veryclean
   $>make

The executable file annsim is generated in the annsim directory

5) USAGE
========
The executable annsim have 4 mandatory command line options.
Here, mandatory means that without specifying this option, the program won't work.

annsim command synopsis:

	 annsim <graph> <terms> <annotations 1> <annotations 2>

The following are the command line options:

<graph>	      	      # Ontology graph file
<terms>		      # File with the terms of the ontology
<annotations 1>	      # File with annotations from the first concept
<annotations 2>	      # File with annotations from the second concept


6) RUNNING SOME SAMPLES
=======================
1) Compute the value of similarity between two genes.

$>./annsim test/ACM_BCB_dataset3/go/goGraph.txt test/ACM_BCB_dataset3/go/go-term-desc.txt test/ACM_BCB_dataset3/5-f-atpase/AtVHA-A.annt test/ACM_BCB_dataset3/5-f-atpase/AtVHA-C.annt

2) Compute the value of similarity between two drugs.

$>./annsim test/ACM_BCB_dataset2/ncit/graphNCI.txt test/ACM_BCB_dataset2/ncit/nci-term-desc.txt test/ACM_BCB_dataset2/Catumaxomab.txt test/ACM_BCB_dataset2/Panitumumab.txt

7) AnnSim File Formats
==========================
The following explains the formats of the files used in the computation of the metric.

7.1) Graph File Format
======================
The graph of the ontology must be an Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG).
The vertices of the graph are the identifiers of the terms of the ontology.
The first line has the following format:

<<number of nodes>>[TAB]<<number of arcs>>

Where <<number of nodes>> is the number de vertices of the graph,
[TAB] is the tab space, and <<number of arcs>> is the number the arcs
of the graph. The following lines in the file specify
a source node, a  target node, and the cost of the arc:

<<source node1>>[TAB]<<target node1 >>[TAB]<<cost1>>
..
..
..
<<source nodeN>>[TAB]<<target nodeN>>[TAB]<<costN>>

7.2) File format of identifiers
===============================
We have a file with the IDs of the terms of the ontology and its description
The format is as follows:
<<Number of terms>>
<<Term1>>[TAB]<<Description of the term1>>
..
..
..
<<TermN>>[TAB]<<Description of the termN>>

Note that the number of terms must be equal to the number of nodes of the graph.

7.3) Annotation File Format
===========================
The format is as follows:

<<Number of annotations>>
<<annotation1>>
..
..
..
<<annotationN>>

Where <<annotationX>> is the identifier of the annotation in the ontology.
