These are the data files to obtain the similarities
to upload in the CESSM evaluation online tool [1].

Folder content:

* cellular_annt: Protein annotations with GO type Cellular Component.
* molecularFunction_annt: Protein annotations with GO type Molecular Function.
* process_annt: Protein annotations with GO type Biological Process.
* runCellular.sh: Shell script to obtain the protein similarities using the GO type Cellular Component.
* runMolecularFunction.sh: Shell script to obtain the protein similarities using the GO type Molecular Function. 
* runBiologicalProcess.sh: Shell script to obtain the protein similarities using the GO type Biological Process.

Run a shell script to obtain the pairwise protein similarities.
The shell script output is a file with extension .out.
The .out file is the file to upload in [2].
